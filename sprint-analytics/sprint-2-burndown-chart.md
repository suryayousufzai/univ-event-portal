## Chart Description

The Sprint 2 burndown chart shows excellent team performance. While day 1 was spent on planning, days 2-4 showed aggressive progress with the team completing work ahead of the ideal pace. The steeper burndown on days 2 and 3 demonstrates the team's improved velocity from Sprint 1.
