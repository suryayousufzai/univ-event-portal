## Chart Description

The burndown chart shows steady progress throughout Sprint 1. We started slightly behind the ideal line on days 1-2 due to initial setup, but caught up and stayed ahead of schedule from day 3 onwards. The chart demonstrates consistent velocity with a clean burndown to zero by day 7.
