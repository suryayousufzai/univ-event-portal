## Chart Description

Sprint 4 burndown chart shows our highest daily velocity (7.5 points/day). The team completed 10 points on day 1, staying ahead of the ideal line. This aggressive pace was possible because we built on existing Sprint 3 features rather than creating everything from scratch.

## Sprint Comparison

| Sprint | Duration | Story Points | Velocity |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Sprint 1 | 7 days | 16 | 2.3 pts/day |

| Sprint 3 | 4 days | 21 | 5.25 pts/day |
