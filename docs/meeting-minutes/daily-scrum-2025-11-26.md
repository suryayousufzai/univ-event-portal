# **2. Sprint 2 Review – Demo and Feedback**

## **Backend Demo – Fariba**
Fariba walked through all backend APIs, including registration, payments, tickets, user history, and cancellation with refund.  
Everything worked smoothly in Postman, and she confirmed backend Sprint 2 is fully complete.

Muneera demonstrated:  

- Event Details page  
- Registration → Payment flow  
- Ticket Design page

### ⚠️ Small Issue During the Demo  
When testing the registration → payment flow, one UI update didn’t behave as expected.

- UI wasn’t handling one response properly  

**Fariba** said she would fix it **right after the meeting**, and the team agreed it was a minor issue.
