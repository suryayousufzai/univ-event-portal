## What to Improve for Sprint 3

### Decisions Made:

1. **Extend Sprint 3 to 5 days** (Nov 27 - Dec 1)
   - Give team more breathing room
   - More time for testing and polish

2. **Start testing earlier**
   - Begin testing on Day 2 instead of Day 3

3. **Better task breakdown**
   - Break work into smaller, trackable pieces

4. **Mid-sprint checkpoint**
   - Quick check-in on Day 2 or 3

5. **Daily documentation updates**
   - Don't leave everything for last day

## Team Happiness

**Sprint 2 Satisfaction:** 4/5
