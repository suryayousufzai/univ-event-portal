## Backend Updates – Fariba

**FARIBA (Backend Lead):**  
> Morning! Yesterday I reviewed all my Sprint 2 tasks, so I’m ready to dive in.  
> **Today’s plan:** Build the Event Registration API:  
> 1. Check if user is logged in (JWT token verification)  
> 2. Check if event has available seats  
> 3. Create a registration record in DB  
> 4. Decrease available seats by 1  
> 5. Return registration confirmation  

> Also, I’ll update the **registrations table** in the database so everything is ready.  
> I aim to finish the basic API today so Muneera can start integrating tomorrow. ✅  
> **Blockers:** None

## Frontend Updates – Muneera

**MUNEERA (Frontend Lead):**  
> Hey team! Yesterday I went through the Sprint 2 plan and wireframes.  
> **Today’s plan:** Build the **Event Details page**:  
> - Clicking an event card shows full event info: image, title, description, date, time, location, price, available seats  
> - Big **“Register Now”** button at the bottom  
> - Prepare registration confirmation modal (“Are you sure you want to register?” with Yes/No buttons)  

> Goal: Finish the Event Details page today.  
> **Blockers:** None
